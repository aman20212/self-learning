**What is Version Control ?**
---Version Control is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later. These versions are recorded in a repository and can be recalled from the same. There are Local, Centralized and Distributed Version Control Systems.

**Why Version Control System**
a. Collaboration : Shared Workspace
b. Manage Versions : All Versions of code are preserved
c. Rollbacks: Easy rolback from current version
d. Reduce Downtime: Reverse Faulty update and save time
e. Analyse Project: Analyze and Compare project

**What is Repository**
A repository or a repo is a directory or storage space where your projects can live.It can be local to a folder on your computer, or it can be storage space on another online host (such as github). You can keep code files, text files, image files, you name it inside  a repository.

**What is Git**
Git is a Distributed Version Control tool that supports distributed non-linear workflows by providing data assurance for developing quality software. It lets you and your team o developers work together on the same project from anywhere. Team members can work on files and easily merge their changes into one source.

**Git Features**
1. Economical: Released under GPL's licence. It is free and open source.
2. Non-Linear: Supports non-linear development of software.
3. Snapshots: Records changes made to a file rather than file itself.
4. Distributed: Every user has his own copy of the repository data stored locally.
5. Speed: Speed offered by GIt is lightening fast compared to other VCSs.
6. Robustness: Nearly every task in Git is undo-able.
7. Integriry: No changes can be made withoout Git recording it.
8. Branching: Every collaborator's working directory is a branch by itself.
